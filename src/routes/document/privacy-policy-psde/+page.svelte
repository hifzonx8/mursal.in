  <h1 class="text-6xl pb-5 select-none">privacy policy</h1>
  <p class="m-2">
    Dapoer Emas ("we", "our", "us") is a mobile application which primarily
    functions as a WebView wrapper for displaying web content fully controlled
    by us.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p class="my-2 ml-5">
    We do not actively collect, store, or share any personal or non-personal
    data from users within our mobile applications. However, the WebView
    displays content hosted and controlled by us, and during this process, the
    following non-personal information may be used automatically:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-7">
    <li>The user's timezone</li>
    <li>The user's IP address (inherent in all internet requests)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="my-2 ml-5">
    This data is not stored, logged, or shared, and is used only in real time to
    adjust display behavior (e.g., formatting timestamps).
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">2. Third Party Services</h2>
  <p class="my-2 ml-5">
    The app integrates with Firebase, a third-party service provided by Google,
    which may automatically collect limited non-personal data such as device
    type, app version, or crash diagnostics. This data is used to improve app
    stability and performance and is not used by us to identify or track users.
    We do not store, access, or share any personal information ourselves.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">3. Children Privacy</h2>
  <p class="my-2 ml-5">
    Our apps do not knowingly collect any data from children under 13. As we do
    not collect user data at all, we comply with child privacy laws such as
    COPPA.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">4. Security</h2>
  <p class="my-2 ml-5">
    We use secure protocols (HTTPS) to serve web content and do not transmit or
    retain user data in the app or backend.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold">5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p class="my-2 ml-5">
    If we update how the app or website uses data, we will revise this Privacy
    Policy accordingly and update the “Effective Date” above.
  </p>
